# Hello, I'm Josh.

I am a first year Biostatistics ScM candidate at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. While I am still developing my research interests, my undergraduate education and subsequent research experiences were devoted to understanding brain function and its relation to psychiatric illness.
