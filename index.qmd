# Hi, folks!

I am a first year Biostatistics ScM candidate at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. While I am still developing my research interests, my undergraduate education and subsequent research experiences were devoted to understanding brain function and its relation to psychiatric illness.

In my free time, I enjoy running, traveling, going on walks with friends, and spending quality time with my partner, Chlo√©, and dog, Chewy.
