# biostat777-intro-josh-stim
My name is Josh Stim, and (as of 2023) I am a first year Biostatistics ScM student at Johns Hopkins. I wanted to create a website to market my past experiences as well as 
the skills I am learning in my graduate program. The goal of this website is to serve as a central hub for anyone who is interested in learning more about me and what I do 
(or would like to do) professionally. I hope you enjoy it.

Briefly, my personal website was created using Quarto through RStudio. It contains a Landing (home) page, an About page, and a page containing an example data analysis. 
The website was deployed through github pages.
