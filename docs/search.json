    "text": "This image of Camden Yards (home of the Baltimore Orioles) was obtained from (“Virtual Backgrounds,” n.d.).\n\n\nBased in Camden Yards in Baltimore, MD, the Orioles are beloved by many Baltimoreans. It is interesting to note, however, that they were not always located in Baltimore! In fact, the franchise began in Milwaukee, Wisconsin in 1901, where they were called the “Milwaukee Brewers” (not to be confused with the Milwaukee Brewers that exist today). In 1902, the franchise moved to St. Louis, where they stayed for 53 years until the end of 1953. At the time, they were one of two teams in St. Louis; the other team was the Cardinals (yes, St. Louis Cardinals). Finally, in 1954, the team moved to Baltimore where they came to be known as the Baltimore Orioles.\nAs is common in most sports, baseball team performance varies over time. The nature of this variation depends on factors such as the quality of the athletes, changes to the rule book, and team strategies, among other things. Here, we examine how overall team performance (measured by win percentage) and batting performance of the Baltimore Orioles has changed since 1902.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nBecause the frachise was in Milwaukee for only 1 year (1901), I decided to exclude this season from my analysis. In the following analysis, we look at 53 seasons of the St. Louis Browns (1902 - 1953), and 70 seasons of the Baltimore Orioles (1954 - 2023).\n\n\n\n\n\nIn particular, I seek to answer the following question about the Orioles:\nFrom 1902 to 2023,\n\nHow does winning percentage change over time?\nHow does the frequency of different types of hits change over time?\nHow does overall batting performance change over time?\nHow does frequency of non-hit batting outcomes change over time?\n\n\n\n\nThis analysis is intended for anyone who is interested in baseball history. Even if you are not an Orioles fan, this analysis may still be of interest, since a number of the trends observed here likely reflect league-wide rule changes and gameplay tendencies.\n\n\n\nThe data for this analysis were obtained from (“Stathead Team Batting,” n.d.), which provides endless sports data on team and player performances at the game and season levels. As part of my analysis, I wanted to isolate seasons that corresponded to winning the world-series, the division, or the wildcard. I was able to determine which seasons these were by referencing (“Baltimore Orioles” 2023).\nI decided to create my own data dictionary. You may find that at the end of this article.\n\n\n\nFor this analysis, I will use functions from the tidyverse, readxl, patchwork, and knitr libraries in R.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(\"tidyverse\")\nlibrary(\"readxl\")\nlibrary(\"patchwork\")\nlibrary(\"knitr\")\n\n\nThe data were downloaded from (“Stathead Team Batting,” n.d.) and will be imported into R using the read_excel function.\n\n\nCode\nbmore.data.raw &lt;- read_excel(\"./data/baltimore_orioles.xlsx\")\nglimpse(bmore.data.raw)\n\n\nRows: 123\nColumns: 31\n$ Rk           &lt;dbl&gt; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17…\n$ Season       &lt;dbl&gt; 2023, 2022, 2021, 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016, 2015, 201…\n$ Team         &lt;chr&gt; \"BAL\", \"BAL\", \"BAL\", \"BAL\", \"BAL\", \"BAL\", \"BAL\", \"BAL\", \"…\n$ Lg           &lt;chr&gt; \"AL\", \"AL\", \"AL\", \"AL\", \"AL\", \"AL\", \"AL\", \"AL\", \"AL\", \"AL…\n$ W            &lt;dbl&gt; 101, 83, 52, 25, 54, 47, 75, 89, 81, 96, 85, 93, 69, 66, …\n$ GP           &lt;dbl&gt; 162, 162, 162, 60, 162, 162, 162, 162, 162, 162, 162, 162…\n$ L            &lt;dbl&gt; 61, 79, 110, 35, 108, 115, 87, 73, 81, 66, 77, 69, 93, 96…\n$ `Bat#`       &lt;dbl&gt; 31, 32, 44, 21, 45, 45, 41, 40, 43, 39, 41, 39, 37, 36, 3…\n$ PA           &lt;dbl&gt; 6123, 6049, 5983, 2242, 6189, 6034, 6140, 6089, 6007, 613…\n$ AB           &lt;dbl&gt; 5495, 5429, 5420, 2026, 5596, 5507, 5650, 5524, 5485, 559…\n$ R            &lt;dbl&gt; 807, 674, 659, 274, 729, 622, 743, 744, 713, 705, 745, 71…\n$ H            &lt;dbl&gt; 1399, 1281, 1296, 523, 1379, 1317, 1469, 1413, 1370, 1434…\n$ single       &lt;dbl&gt; 879, 810, 820, 337, 889, 872, 956, 889, 887, 943, 936, 87…\n$ double       &lt;dbl&gt; 309, 275, 266, 102, 252, 242, 269, 265, 246, 264, 298, 27…\n$ triple       &lt;dbl&gt; 28, 25, 15, 7, 25, 15, 12, 6, 20, 16, 14, 16, 13, 21, 19,…\n$ HR           &lt;dbl&gt; 183, 171, 195, 77, 213, 188, 232, 253, 217, 211, 212, 214…\n$ RBI          &lt;dbl&gt; 780, 639, 632, 264, 698, 593, 713, 710, 686, 681, 719, 67…\n$ SB           &lt;dbl&gt; 114, 95, 54, 19, 84, 81, 32, 19, 44, 44, 79, 58, 81, 76, …\n$ CS           &lt;dbl&gt; 24, 31, 23, 14, 30, 22, 13, 13, 25, 20, 29, 29, 25, 34, 3…\n$ BB           &lt;dbl&gt; 512, 476, 451, 164, 462, 422, 392, 468, 418, 401, 416, 48…\n$ SO           &lt;dbl&gt; 1370, 1390, 1454, 514, 1435, 1412, 1412, 1324, 1331, 1285…\n$ OBP          &lt;dbl&gt; 0.321, 0.305, 0.304, 0.321, 0.310, 0.298, 0.312, 0.317, 0…\n$ GIDP         &lt;dbl&gt; 114, 95, 105, 32, 111, 132, 138, 119, 127, 112, 105, 152,…\n$ HBP          &lt;dbl&gt; 45, 83, 65, 27, 71, 57, 50, 44, 51, 62, 36, 50, 52, 54, 3…\n$ SH           &lt;dbl&gt; 21, 12, 14, 15, 22, 13, 10, 17, 20, 35, 27, 38, 24, 31, 1…\n$ SF           &lt;dbl&gt; 47, 43, 31, 10, 37, 35, 37, 36, 32, 36, 45, 30, 43, 45, 4…\n$ IBB          &lt;dbl&gt; 14, 10, 12, 5, 8, 19, 12, 19, 23, 29, 36, 24, 24, 32, 25,…\n$ LOB          &lt;dbl&gt; 1041, 1095, 1046, 410, 1063, 1027, 1041, 1065, 990, 1088,…\n$ Div_Champ    &lt;dbl&gt; 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, …\n$ Wild_Card    &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, …\n$ World_Series &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, …\n\n\n\n\n\nThe raw data does not include classical baseball statistics such as batting average, win percentage, and slugging.

Normally, at-bats (AB) are used in the denominator when calculating frequency of different hit types. However, because BB, IBB, and HBP are not possible outcomes for an AB, and I wanted to have consistent measures for hit and non-hit frequencies, I decided to use PA instead of AB in the denominators.\nThe only exception to this is when I computed batting average (BA) and slugging (SLG). These are classical baseball statistics commonly referenced by baseball experts and fans alike. Therefore, I did not want to deviate from these standard formulas by using PA instead of AB.\n\n\n\n\n\nWere the Orioles ever “good”? The answer to this depends on how you define “good”. Suppose that “good” just means a winning record (i.e., Win_percent &gt; 50). If this is the case, then the Orioles were a “good” team for 46 of the 122 seasons examined here. That is, in \\(38\\%\\) of their seasons, the Orioles had a winning record (or they had a losing record for \\(62\\%\\) of seasons). While this certainly isn’t that impressive over the long run, the Orioles were actually very good during mid-60’s to mid 80’s (see (O’Nair 2023) for a list of the best Orioles teams ever). In fact, they had a winning record for 20 of their 21 seasons (\\(95\\%\\)) between 1965 and 1985 and won 3 world series and 7 division championships. This was the golden age for the Baltimore Orioles, and was in no small part due to their excellent roster of future hall-of-famers. The Orioles have been less consistent in the 2000’s; aside from a few winning seasons, such as the recent 2023 season which culminated in \\(&gt;\\) 100 wins (one of only 6 occurrences in franchise history; see table 1) and a division title, they have only obtained winning record for 6 out of the 24 seasons (\\(25\\%\\)) between 2000 and 2023.\n\n\nCode\nwins100 &lt;- bmore.data.mod %&gt;%\n  filter(W &gt;= 100) %&gt;%\n  select(Season, Team, W, L, Div_Champ, World_Series)\n\nknitr::kable(wins100)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeason\nTeam\nW\nL\nDiv_Champ\nWorld_Series\n\n\n\n\n2023\nBAL\n101\n61\n1\n0\n\n\n1980\nBAL\n100\n62\n0\n0\n\n\n1979\nBAL\n102\n57\n1\n0\n\n\n1971\nBAL\n101\n57\n1\n0\n\n\n1970\nBAL\n108\n54\n1\n1\n\n\n1969\nBAL\n109\n53\n1\n0\n\n\n\nTable 1.

It is clear that the single has always been the most common type of hit, although there has been a somewhat consistent decrease over time. The frequency of double has fluctuated quite a bit over time. In my opinion, the most interesting pattern here is the decline of the triple and rise of the home run. From 1900 - 1920, the triple was at its peak frequency of around 11 per 1000 plate appearance. Since then, however, it has been on the consistent decline to where it sits today at around 3 per 1000 plate appearance. One sensible explanation for this decline is that players are now hitting home runs instead of triples. Indeed, home runs have become much, much more prevalent compared to the early days, rising from around 3 per 1000 at bats from 1900 - 1920 to around 34 per 1000 at bats in the present day. This striking increase in frequency is a known phenomenon and is seen throughout the entire league (Baseball Almanac, n.d.). Experts believe this can be partly explained by faster pitching (Sheinin 2019) (which means greater exit velocity when the ball is hit).\n\n\nCode\nbmore.data.mod %&gt;%\n  select(Season, Team, single.freq, double.freq, triple.freq, HR.freq) %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(cols = c(single.freq, double.freq, triple.freq, HR.freq),\n               names_to = \"hit_type\",\n               values_to = \"freq\") %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x=Season, y=freq, color = Team)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 1954, linetype = \"longdash\") +\n  facet_wrap(~hit_type, scales = \"free\") +\n  geom_smooth(color = \"black\") +\n  labs(title = \"Hit Frequency by Season\",\n       subtitle = \"Home runs are exploding in frequency while triples are on the decline.\",\n       caption = \"Created by Josh Stim using `ggplot2`.\",\n       y = \"Relative Frequency (hits per 1000 PA)\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo more home runs mean greater team batting averages? Surprisingly, no. While batters today are certainly hitting the ball further than they were in the early days, they are also striking out more. Perhaps this is due to a greater swing tendency in batters and better pitching from pitchers; I will return to this later. Does consistent batting averages mean that batters have not gotten better at batting? Absolutely not. As we can see, slugging has actually risen quite a bit since early days (see tables 2 & 3 for top five best and worst seasons for SLG). This makes sense because slugging, unlike batting average, places a greater weight on hits that result in more bases, and so the increase in slugging is due, in part, to the exploding home run rate. Similar to slugging, OPS has increased through the years. Again, this makes sense because OPS includes slugging in its calculation. The other part of OPS is on bases percentage (OBP), which reflects how often players make hits, gets walked, hit by a pitch, etc. The trajectory in the frequency of the latter two outcomes over the years are covered in the next section.\nThe last thing I want to point out here is the batting performance of the St.Louis Browns in the 1920’s. As we can see, this was an extremely productive time for the Brown’s batting-wise, with the highest BA, OBP, and OPS in franchise history occurring in the 1922 season. This batting productivity was certainly due not to home runs, but rather to a higher frequency of singles (195 per 1000 PA) and triples (15 per 1000 PA) and a similar frequency of doubles (48 per 1000 PA) compared to today’s standards (144, 5, and 51, in the 2023 season, respectively).\n\n\nCode\nt2 &lt;- bmore.data.mod %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(SLG)) %&gt;%\n  select(Season, Team, SLG) %&gt;%\n  head(5)\nknitr::kable(t2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeason\nTeam\nSLG\n\n\n\n\n1996\nBAL\n0.4719634\n\n\n1922\nSLB\n0.4530876\n\n\n1999\nBAL\n0.4474011\n\n\n1998\nBAL\n0.4469003\n\n\n2016\nBAL\n0.4433382\n\n\n\nTable 2.

But what about other outcomes that may occur at the plate? Here, we look at how the number of strikeouts (SO), walks (BB), intentional walks (IBB), and hit by pitch occurrences (HBP) has fluctuated over time. Perhaps most striking is the dramatic increase in SO’s over the years, which is likely due to stronger pitching in the present day. It’s also possible that there are more SO’s because batters are swinging at more pitches. While I do not analyze swing rate here, it might be something worth looking into for a future analysis.\nAnother notable observation is the pattern of intentional walks over time, which unsurprisingly reached a striking peak during the teams “best years” from mid 60’s to the mid-80’s. I say this is unsurprising because usually teams with really good batters rack up more intentional walks, at least in the present day. It is peculiar, however, that IBB was on the steady rise from 1924 until around 1974, and then was on the steady decline until the present day. This makes me think that IBB cannot be explained solely by team hitting performance, but could be influenced by league-wide gameplay tendencies. I would be curious to see if other teams follow a similar historical pattern as observed here.\nFinally, the pattern of HBP occurrences over time is quite interesting as well. Notably, HBP rate decreased sharply from about 8 per 1000 PA in the 1910’s to nearly 3 per 1000 PA in the mid-to-late 1940’s and then steadily rose again to around 10 per 1000 PA in the present day. The explanation for this pattern escapes me, but I would be very interested to hear hypothesis and suggestions for follow up analyses.\n\n\nCode\nbmore.data.mod %&gt;%\n  select(Season, Team, SO.freq, BB.freq, IBB.freq, HBP.freq) %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(cols = c(SO.freq, BB.freq, IBB.freq, HBP.freq),\n               names_to = \"outcome\",\n               values_to = \"freq\") %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x=Season, y=freq, color = Team)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 1954, linetype = \"longdash\") +\n  facet_wrap(~outcome, scales = \"free\") +\n  geom_smooth(color = \"black\") +\n  labs(title = \"Occurrences of Non-hit Batting Outcomes by Season\",\n       subtitle = \"SO's and HBP are gaining in prevalence over time.

    "text": "This image of Camden Yards (home of the Baltimore Orioles) was obtained from (“Virtual Backgrounds,” n.d.).\n\n\nBased in Camden Yards in Baltimore, MD, the Orioles are beloved by many Baltimoreans. It is interesting to note, however, that they were not always located in Baltimore! In fact, the franchise began in Milwaukee, Wisconsin in 1901, where they were called the “Milwaukee Brewers” (not to be confused with the Milwaukee Brewers that exist today). In 1902, the franchise moved to St. Louis, where they stayed for 53 years until the end of 1953. At the time, they were one of two teams in St. Louis; the other team was the Cardinals (yes, St. Louis Cardinals). Finally, in 1954, the team moved to Baltimore where they came to be known as the Baltimore Orioles.\nAs is common in most sports, baseball team performance varies over time. The nature of this variation depends on factors such as the quality of the athletes, changes to the rule book, and team strategies, among other things. Here, we examine how overall team performance (measured by win percentage) and batting performance of the Baltimore Orioles has changed since 1902.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nBecause the frachise was in Milwaukee for only 1 year (1901), I decided to exclude this season from my analysis. In the following analysis, we look at 53 seasons of the St. Louis Browns (1902 - 1953), and 70 seasons of the Baltimore Orioles (1954 - 2023).\n\n\n\n\n\nIn particular, I seek to answer the following question about the Orioles:\nFrom 1902 to 2023,\n\nHow does winning percentage change over time?\nHow does the frequency of different types of hits change over time?\nHow does overall batting performance change over time?\nHow does frequency of non-hit batting outcomes change over time?\n\n\n\n\nThis analysis is intended for anyone who is interested in baseball history. Even if you are not an Orioles fan, this analysis may still be of interest, since a number of the trends observed here likely reflect league-wide rule changes and gameplay tendencies.\n\n\n\nThe data for this analysis were obtained from (“Stathead Team Batting,” n.d.), which provides endless sports data on team and player performances at the game and season levels. As part of my analysis, I wanted to isolate seasons that corresponded to winning the world-series, the division, or the wildcard. I was able to determine which seasons these were by referencing (“Baltimore Orioles” 2023).\nI decided to create my own data dictionary. You may find that at the end of this article.\n\n\n\nFor this analysis, I will use functions from the tidyverse, readxl, patchwork, and knitr libraries in R.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(\"tidyverse\")\nlibrary(\"readxl\")\nlibrary(\"patchwork\")\nlibrary(\"knitr\")\n\n\nThe data were downloaded from (“Stathead Team Batting,” n.d.) and will be imported into R using the read_excel function.\n\n\nCode\nbmore.data.raw &lt;- read_excel(\"./data/baltimore_orioles.xlsx\")\nglimpse(bmore.data.raw)\n\n\nRows: 123\nColumns: 31\n$ Rk           &lt;dbl&gt; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17…\n$ Season       &lt;dbl&gt; 2023, 2022, 2021, 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016, 2015, 201…\n$ Team         &lt;chr&gt; \"BAL\", \"BAL\", \"BAL\", \"BAL\", \"BAL\", \"BAL\", \"BAL\", \"BAL\", \"…\n$ Lg           &lt;chr&gt; \"AL\", \"AL\", \"AL\", \"AL\", \"AL\", \"AL\", \"AL\", \"AL\", \"AL\", \"AL…\n$ W            &lt;dbl&gt; 101, 83, 52, 25, 54, 47, 75, 89, 81, 96, 85, 93, 69, 66, …\n$ GP           &lt;dbl&gt; 162, 162, 162, 60, 162, 162, 162, 162, 162, 162, 162, 162…\n$ L            &lt;dbl&gt; 61, 79, 110, 35, 108, 115, 87, 73, 81, 66, 77, 69, 93, 96…\n$ `Bat#`       &lt;dbl&gt; 31, 32, 44, 21, 45, 45, 41, 40, 43, 39, 41, 39, 37, 36, 3…\n$ PA           &lt;dbl&gt; 6123, 6049, 5983, 2242, 6189, 6034, 6140, 6089, 6007, 613…\n$ AB           &lt;dbl&gt; 5495, 5429, 5420, 2026, 5596, 5507, 5650, 5524, 5485, 559…\n$ R            &lt;dbl&gt; 807, 674, 659, 274, 729, 622, 743, 744, 713, 705, 745, 71…\n$ H            &lt;dbl&gt; 1399, 1281, 1296, 523, 1379, 1317, 1469, 1413, 1370, 1434…\n$ single       &lt;dbl&gt; 879, 810, 820, 337, 889, 872, 956, 889, 887, 943, 936, 87…\n$ double       &lt;dbl&gt; 309, 275, 266, 102, 252, 242, 269, 265, 246, 264, 298, 27…\n$ triple       &lt;dbl&gt; 28, 25, 15, 7, 25, 15, 12, 6, 20, 16, 14, 16, 13, 21, 19,…\n$ HR           &lt;dbl&gt; 183, 171, 195, 77, 213, 188, 232, 253, 217, 211, 212, 214…\n$ RBI          &lt;dbl&gt; 780, 639, 632, 264, 698, 593, 713, 710, 686, 681, 719, 67…\n$ SB           &lt;dbl&gt; 114, 95, 54, 19, 84, 81, 32, 19, 44, 44, 79, 58, 81, 76, …\n$ CS           &lt;dbl&gt; 24, 31, 23, 14, 30, 22, 13, 13, 25, 20, 29, 29, 25, 34, 3…\n$ BB           &lt;dbl&gt; 512, 476, 451, 164, 462, 422, 392, 468, 418, 401, 416, 48…\n$ SO           &lt;dbl&gt; 1370, 1390, 1454, 514, 1435, 1412, 1412, 1324, 1331, 1285…\n$ OBP          &lt;dbl&gt; 0.321, 0.305, 0.304, 0.321, 0.310, 0.298, 0.312, 0.317, 0…\n$ GIDP         &lt;dbl&gt; 114, 95, 105, 32, 111, 132, 138, 119, 127, 112, 105, 152,…\n$ HBP          &lt;dbl&gt; 45, 83, 65, 27, 71, 57, 50, 44, 51, 62, 36, 50, 52, 54, 3…\n$ SH           &lt;dbl&gt; 21, 12, 14, 15, 22, 13, 10, 17, 20, 35, 27, 38, 24, 31, 1…\n$ SF           &lt;dbl&gt; 47, 43, 31, 10, 37, 35, 37, 36, 32, 36, 45, 30, 43, 45, 4…\n$ IBB          &lt;dbl&gt; 14, 10, 12, 5, 8, 19, 12, 19, 23, 29, 36, 24, 24, 32, 25,…\n$ LOB          &lt;dbl&gt; 1041, 1095, 1046, 410, 1063, 1027, 1041, 1065, 990, 1088,…\n$ Div_Champ    &lt;dbl&gt; 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, …\n$ Wild_Card    &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, …\n$ World_Series &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, …\n\n\n\n\n\nThe raw data does not include classical baseball statistics such as batting average, win percentage, and slugging.

Normally, at-bats (AB) are used in the denominator when calculating frequency of different hit types. However, because BB, IBB, and HBP are not possible outcomes for an AB, and I wanted to have consistent measures for hit and non-hit frequencies, I decided to use PA instead of AB in the denominators.\nThe only exception to this is when I computed batting average (BA) and slugging (SLG). These are classical baseball statistics commonly referenced by baseball experts and fans alike. Therefore, I did not want to deviate from these standard formulas by using PA instead of AB.\n\n\n\n\n\nWere the Orioles ever “good”? The answer to this depends on how you define “good”. Suppose that “good” just means a winning record (i.e., Win_percent &gt; 50). If this is the case, then the Orioles were a “good” team for 46 of the 122 seasons examined here. That is, in \\(38\\%\\) of their seasons, the Orioles had a winning record (or they had a losing record for \\(62\\%\\) of seasons). While this certainly isn’t that impressive over the long run, the Orioles were actually very good during mid-60’s to mid 80’s (see (O’Nair 2023) for a list of the best Orioles teams ever). In fact, they had a winning record for 20 of their 21 seasons (\\(95\\%\\)) between 1965 and 1985 and won 3 world series and 7 division championships. This was the golden age for the Baltimore Orioles, and was in no small part due to their excellent roster of future hall-of-famers. The Orioles have been less consistent in the 2000’s; aside from a few winning seasons, such as the recent 2023 season which culminated in \\(&gt;\\) 100 wins (one of only 6 occurrences in franchise history; see table 1) and a division title, they have only obtained winning record for 6 out of the 24 seasons (\\(25\\%\\)) between 2000 and 2023.\n\n\nCode\nwins100 &lt;- bmore.data.mod %&gt;%\n  filter(W &gt;= 100) %&gt;%\n  select(Season, Team, W, L, Div_Champ, World_Series)\n\nknitr::kable(wins100)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeason\nTeam\nW\nL\nDiv_Champ\nWorld_Series\n\n\n\n\n2023\nBAL\n101\n61\n1\n0\n\n\n1980\nBAL\n100\n62\n0\n0\n\n\n1979\nBAL\n102\n57\n1\n0\n\n\n1971\nBAL\n101\n57\n1\n0\n\n\n1970\nBAL\n108\n54\n1\n1\n\n\n1969\nBAL\n109\n53\n1\n0\n\n\n\nTable 1.

It is clear that the single has always been the most common type of hit, although there has been a somewhat consistent decrease over time. The frequency of double has fluctuated quite a bit over time. In my opinion, the most interesting pattern here is the decline of the triple and rise of the home run. From 1900 - 1920, the triple was at its peak frequency of around 11 per 1000 plate appearance. Since then, however, it has been on the consistent decline to where it sits today at around 3 per 1000 plate appearance. One sensible explanation for this decline is that players are now hitting home runs instead of triples. Indeed, home runs have become much, much more prevalent compared to the early days, rising from around 3 per 1000 at bats from 1900 - 1920 to around 34 per 1000 at bats in the present day. This striking increase in frequency is a known phenomenon and is seen throughout the entire league (Baseball Almanac, n.d.). Experts believe this can be partly explained by faster pitching (Sheinin 2019) (which means greater exit velocity when the ball is hit).\n\n\nCode\nbmore.data.mod %&gt;%\n  select(Season, Team, single.freq, double.freq, triple.freq, HR.freq) %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(cols = c(single.freq, double.freq, triple.freq, HR.freq),\n               names_to = \"hit_type\",\n               values_to = \"freq\") %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x=Season, y=freq, color = Team)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 1954, linetype = \"longdash\") +\n  facet_wrap(~hit_type, scales = \"free\") +\n  geom_smooth(color = \"black\") +\n  labs(title = \"Hit Frequency by Season\",\n       subtitle = \"Home runs are exploding in frequency while triples are on the decline.\",\n       caption = \"Created by Josh Stim using `ggplot2`.\",\n       y = \"Relative Frequency (hits per 1000 PA)\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo more home runs mean greater team batting averages? Surprisingly, no. While batters today are certainly hitting the ball further than they were in the early days, they are also striking out more. Perhaps this is due to a greater swing tendency in batters and better pitching from pitchers; I will return to this later. Does consistent batting averages mean that batters have not gotten better at batting? Absolutely not. As we can see, slugging has actually risen quite a bit since early days (see tables 2 & 3 for top five best and worst seasons for SLG). This makes sense because slugging, unlike batting average, places a greater weight on hits that result in more bases, and so the increase in slugging is due, in part, to the exploding home run rate. Similar to slugging, OPS has increased through the years. Again, this makes sense because OPS includes slugging in its calculation. The other part of OPS is on bases percentage (OBP), which reflects how often players make hits, gets walked, hit by a pitch, etc. The trajectory in the frequency of the latter two outcomes over the years are covered in the next section.\nThe last thing I want to point out here is the batting performance of the St.Louis Browns in the 1920’s. As we can see, this was an extremely productive time for the Brown’s batting-wise, with the highest BA, OBP, and OPS in franchise history occurring in the 1922 season. This batting productivity was certainly due not to home runs, but rather to a higher frequency of singles (195 per 1000 PA) and triples (15 per 1000 PA) and a similar frequency of doubles (48 per 1000 PA) compared to today’s standards (144, 5, and 51, in the 2023 season, respectively).\n\n\nCode\nt2 &lt;- bmore.data.mod %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(SLG)) %&gt;%\n  select(Season, Team, SLG) %&gt;%\n  head(5)\nknitr::kable(t2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeason\nTeam\nSLG\n\n\n\n\n1996\nBAL\n0.4719634\n\n\n1922\nSLB\n0.4530876\n\n\n1999\nBAL\n0.4474011\n\n\n1998\nBAL\n0.4469003\n\n\n2016\nBAL\n0.4433382\n\n\n\nTable 2.

But what about other outcomes that may occur at the plate? Here, we look at how the number of strikeouts (SO), walks (BB), intentional walks (IBB), and hit by pitch occurrences (HBP) has fluctuated over time. Perhaps most striking is the dramatic increase in SO’s over the years, which is likely due to stronger pitching in the present day. It’s also possible that there are more SO’s because batters are swinging at more pitches. While I do not analyze swing rate here, it might be something worth looking into for a future analysis.\nAnother notable observation is the pattern of intentional walks over time, which unsurprisingly reached a striking peak during the teams “best years” from mid 60’s to the mid-80’s. I say this is unsurprising because usually teams with really good batters rack up more intentional walks, at least in the present day. It is peculiar, however, that IBB was on the steady rise from 1924 until around 1974, and then was on the steady decline until the present day. This makes me think that IBB cannot be explained solely by team hitting performance, but could be influenced by league-wide gameplay tendencies. I would be curious to see if other teams follow a similar historical pattern as observed here.\nFinally, the pattern of HBP occurrences over time is quite interesting as well. Notably, HBP rate decreased sharply from about 8 per 1000 PA in the 1910’s to nearly 3 per 1000 PA in the mid-to-late 1940’s and then steadily rose again to around 10 per 1000 PA in the present day. The explanation for this pattern escapes me, but I would be very interested to hear hypothesis and suggestions for follow up analyses.\n\n\nCode\nbmore.data.mod %&gt;%\n  select(Season, Team, SO.freq, BB.freq, IBB.freq, HBP.freq) %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(cols = c(SO.freq, BB.freq, IBB.freq, HBP.freq),\n               names_to = \"outcome\",\n               values_to = \"freq\") %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x=Season, y=freq, color = Team)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 1954, linetype = \"longdash\") +\n  facet_wrap(~outcome, scales = \"free\") +\n  geom_smooth(color = \"black\") +\n  labs(title = \"Occurrences of Non-hit Batting Outcomes by Season\",\n       subtitle = \"SO's and HBP are gaining in prevalence over time.
